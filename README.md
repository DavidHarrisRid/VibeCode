# VibeCode Games

This repository contains a simple console-based game collection written in
Python. When you run the program you first see a small menu where you can
choose to start Tetris, play Snake, play Space Invaders, play Ice Climber, or
quit. After a game ends you are returned to this menu.

The Space Invaders screen is deliberately wider than the other games so the
action more closely resembles the classic arcade layout. The invader formation
is small and begins moving slowly, letting you fire up to two bullets at once
for a bit more firepower. The aliens themselves are drawn larger than a single
character so they are easier targets. Each time the invaders descend a row they
speed up slightly to keep the pressure on.

Ice Climber is a vertical climbing game. Platforms are randomly generated and
each row is bordered so you know exactly where the edges are. Jumping breaks
through the platforms above you and launches the climber several rows high so
you can land on the next ledge. Keep moving upwardâ€”if you slip below the bottom
of the visible area the game is over.


The game relies on the `curses` module for drawing. On Windows systems the
standard Python distribution does not ship with curses. To run the game
install the [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/) package
first:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

Then launch the collection with:

```bash
python VibeCode.py
```

If you see an error about `curses` being missing, make sure you've installed the
`windows-curses` package in the same Python environment.
